Dependencies 

	GL_OES_read_format is required
	
    The extension is written against the OpenGLES 1.0 Specification, 
    which in turn is based OpenGL 1.3. Thus this spec is effectively 
    written against OpenGL 1.3 but does not address sections explicitly 
    removed or reduced by OpenGL-ES 1.0.

Overview 
    
	This extension is intended to supplement the GL_OES_read_format
	extension by adding support for more format/type combinations to be used
	when calling ReadPixels.  ReadPixels currently accepts one fixed
	format/type	combination (format RGBA and type UNSIGNED_BYTE) for
	portability, and an implementation specific format/type combination
	queried using the tokens IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_FORMAT_OES and
	IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_TYPE_OES (GL_OES_read_format extension).  This
	extension adds the following format/type combinations to those currently
	allowed to be returned by GetIntegerV:

    format						type
    ------						----
   	BGRA						UNSIGNED_BYTE
	BGRA						UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV

   	E.g. Calling GetIntegerv with a <pname> parameter of
   	IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_FORMAT_OES can now return BGRA, with the
   	corresponding call to GetIntegerv using a <pname> parameter of
   	IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_TYPE_OES returning UNSIGNED_BYTE;
