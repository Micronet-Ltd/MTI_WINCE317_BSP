    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    FlashFX Tera v2.1 Build 2128CL - General Release (December 2011) 
                      WinCE, VxWorks, Linux, RTOS -- SDKs and CSKs

    General Concepts:
    - Include support for Micron ClearNAND devices.
    - Include support for the i.MX51 controller.
    - Added support for Windows Embedded Compact 7.
    - Improvements to the FAT Monitor.
    - Add support for VxWorks 6.9.
    - Added basic support for ONFI 2.3.
    - Added documentation and sample project for the Linux MTD FIM.
    - General bug fixes.
    
    Support for Micron ClearNAND devices:
    - Added the "Ntstdclrnand" NTM and support files to drive Micron
      Standard ClearNAND devices.
    - Added the Nteclrnand" NTM and support files to drive Micron
      Enhanced ClearNAND devices
    - Modified the Device Manager and FMSL Test to accommodate devices
      with built-in EDC mechanisms that are outside software control.

    Support For the i.MX51 controller:
    - Added the "Ntmx51" NTM and support files to drive the NAND
      controller built into the i.MX51 controller.
    - Added sample projects to use this NTM for Windows Embedded
      Compact 7 and Linux.

    Windows Embedded Compact 7:
    - FlashFX was updated to work with Windows Embedded Compact 7.
      The sample project utilizing the new i.MX51 support is a
      Windows Embedded Compact 7 project.
    
    Improvements to FATMON:
    - The FAT Monitor component (FATMON) has been updated to support
      sector sizes larger than 512 bytes.
      
    VxWorks 6.9:
    - FlashFX was updated to integrate with VxWorks 6.9.
    
    ONFI 2.3:
    - Added simplified ability to read and decode ONFI parameter pages.
      This support is by no means complete; it only allows the
      automatic configuration of device geometry in NTMs that use it.

    Linux MTD FIM
    - Added notes to the user documentation explaining the MTD FIM
      and what it is for.  Also added a sample project that uses
      the FIM.
      
    Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed a bug in which the combination of a read into an unaligned
      buffer with a correctable error occuring during that read could
      cause a failure to copy all of the data into the buffer.
    - Fixed an issue where for large flash arrays, a rounding error
      in some integer arithmetic used to calculate the size of a
      buffer used for compaction could cause an exception to be
      thrown.
    - Other minor fixes, cleanup and reformatting of debug messages.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
    FlashFX Tera v2.0.2 Betas - (May and October 2011)
                                Linux -- SDKs and CSKs

    - Improved performance at startup time when recovering from an
      interrupted compaction (more significant on hardware where 
      region mounting is very slow).
    - Fixed a minor issue so we build correctly on systems with 40-bit
      longs.
    - Corrected the ONFI READ_PARAM command.
    - Fixed Bug 3380, where the VBF write interruption tests, when running
      under simulation, could cause some spurious failures (not an issue
      on real hardware).

    Linux Port:
    - Added a FIM which interfaces to a Linux MTD.
    - Fixed Bug 3503 to get FXINFO fully functional under Linux.
    - Updated the Linux driver to support creating a Linux device when
      there is no valid VBF format on the flash. 

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    FlashFX Tera v2.0.1 Build 2128AC - General Release (February 2011)
                        WinCE, VxWorks, Linux, RTOS -- SDKs and CSKs

    - Fixed a problem in the Device Manager which prevented scrubbing
      notifications from making it up the call stack.
    - Minor revamping of the RTOS driver interfaces to use abstracted
      data types.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    FlashFX Tera v2.0 Build 2128N - General Release (December 2010)
                      WinCE, VxWorks, Linux, RTOS -- SDKs and CSKs

    General Concepts:
    - Major update to support the concept of a Disk which spans multiple 
      Devices.
    - Major update to support "QuickMount" feature.
    - Widespread documentation updates.
                       
    Project Configuration:
    - Each project now has its own dclproj.c and dclproj.mak.  Overridden
      OS Services files which formerly were listed in ffxproj.mak are now
      listed in dclproj.mak.
    - The mechanism for specifying the overridden files, whether they are
      DCL OS Services, FlashFX OS Services, or FlashFX Project Hooks, is
      much simpler and less error prone.
    - Added the ability to configure a Device such that it is specified to 
      start and/or end on a chip boundary, where the exact chip size is not
      known at compile-time.
    - A flag in the FFX_DISKn_SETTINGS setting is used to indicate that you 
      want a RAW mapping. 
    - Updated so that several NAND special features are documented and 
      configurable in the ffxconf.h file, including OTP Support, Legacy,
      SSFDC, and OffsetZero style spare areas.
    - Added a number of new VBF configuration options pertaining to 
      compaction and deferred discards.
      
    Driver Framework Enhancements: 
    - Added a generalized Loader set of functions which provide simpler low 
      level read/write access to the flash. 
      
    VBF Enhancements:
    - Added the ability to defer discards on NAND flash to improve write 
      performance.
    - Major enhancement to the mechanisms used to track candidates for 
      background compaction. 
    - Enhanced so that idle-time (background) compaction can be suspended
      and resumed at run-time.
    - Fixed the region cache size to be configurable either as a percentage 
      of the regions, or using the old, fixed-count mechanism.  In either
      case, memory for the region cache is dynamically allocated in a fashion 
      where none is wasted, regardless what the configuration settings are.
    - Updated so that VBF "cushion" can be specified in vbfconf.h.
    - Fixed a problem in the VBF write interruption test (Bug 2955) for 
      Windows CE 5.x, where bad pointer could be used, corrupting in- 
      memory structures.
      
    Device Manager Enhancements:
    - Resolved Bug 2607, where some latency reduction features had been 
      disabled to avoid a potential corruption of the erase state 
      information in some geometries.     
    - Increased the number of Devices supported in devflash.c from 4 to 8.
    
    Miscellaneous Enhancements:
    - Added support for power suspend and resume.  This feature is controlled 
      with the FFXCONF_POWERSUSPENDRESUME preprocessor setting.  This is
      currently defined at the OS level, in oesl.h.  This is set to TRUE
      only for those operating systems which support it.  The fhaccess.c 
      modules have been updated to support the new types ACCESS_SUSPEND and 
      ACCESS_RESUME. 
    - Updated FXINFO to display more detailed information about region and
      unit metadata.
    - Factored DCLTEST out of the other "DriverAutoTests" so that it can run 
      prior to FlashFX attempting to initialize any Devices and Disks. 
    - Updated the BeagleBoard project to simultaneously support hardware ECC 
      and prefetch mode.
    - Updated the Loader interface to provide a configuration option 
      controlling the AutoUnlock feature.
    - Updated the general call stack to support chip serial numbers.
    - Fixed numerous minor issues that caused compiler warnings when
      building with higher warning levels and newer compilers.
    - Updated the code to work around va_arg() problems with 64-bit types 
      when using the Code Sourcery ARM GNU tools.
    - Corrected the licensing validation logic to work properly with some
      environments where a "long" type is 40-bits wide.
    - Updated FXDUMP to work with NAND "OffsetZero" style images, rather 
      than just SSFDC images.
    - Updated FXIMAGE to ignore areas of the flash which appear to be 
      erased.
      
    NAND Read/Write Modes:
    - Two new NAND specific macros have been added, FMLREAD/
      WRITE_UNCORRECTEDPAGES(), which do what FMLREAD/WRITE_PAGES <used>
      to do when operating on NAND.
    - The functionality of the FMLREAD/WRITE_PAGES() NOW does an ECC 
      validated read or write when running on NAND.  The functionality
      is unchanged when running on NOR.
    - The FMLREAD_CORRECTEDPAGES() macro still exists, but is deprecated -- 
      internally it simply does the same thing as the new FMLREAD_PAGES().
    - These changes allow ECC corrected data to be read and written even if 
      tags are not being used at all, which was not possible before.
    - Updated FMLSTEST to chop out a bunch of logic which is now unnecessary 
      due to the cleaned up FML read/write interfaces.  Now regardless 
      whether running on NAND or NOR, one can use the FMLREAD/WRITE_PAGES()
      macros to read and write corrected data.

    NAND FIM Enhancements:
    - Added support and tests for block lock/unlocking, as well as
      "lock-freeze".
    - Renamed the Get/SetBlockStatus() functions to Get/SetRawBlockStatus() 
      for interface consistency.
    - Added a GetBlockStatus() interface which allows it to be easily 
      determined whether a logical block has been remapped or not.
    - Refactored some NAND related headers to allow easier access to NAND 
      specific functionality from outside the FMSL tree.
    - Enhanced support for Numonyx flash.  
    - Added support for a few Toshiba parts. 
    - Changed most ST Micro references to Numonyx.
    
    General NTM Enhancements:
    - Added an optional IORequest() interface into the NTMs.  The NAND FIM 
      will call this first if it exists.  If the NTM does not handle the
      request,  hen the standard logic in the NAND FIM is used.  Only works
      for non-BBM requests at this time.  This interface is required if
      the block locking, power suspend/resume or OTP functionality is to be 
      supported.
    - Modified all the NTMs so the PageWrite() functionality allows a page to 
      be written with ECC, but no tags.  As before, if ECC is turned
      off, then tags may not be written.
    - Added support for querying and returning chip ID values to higher level 
      software.
    - Refactored the ECC hooks modules, to include the ability to hook the 
      correction function.  Updated NTMs which use those hooks accordingly. 
    - Many NTM helper functions were renamed to avoid naming conflicts.
    
    Micron NTM Enhancements:
    - Enhanced support for Micron M60 devices.
    - Refactored the Micron NTM and hooks modules to be more flexible.
    - Refactored the hooks modules so that the entire spare area is under
      control of project code.
    - Updated so that any buffer alignment requirements are specified by 
      the hook module.
    - Updated the Micron NTM to support multiple chip selects.
    - Updated the Micron NTM to support block locking.
    - Updated the Micron NTM to support chip serial numbers.
    
    PXA320 NTM Enhancements:
    - Updated to fully support two flash chips.
    - Modified to allow support for the second chip to be disabled at
      compile-time.
    - Now use allocated instance data, in the case that the OEM want to 
      separately control the two chips (still requires some outside
      synchronization).
    - Fixed to cleanly fail initialization if there are no blocks 
      remaining after the reserved space has been removed. 
    - Refactored the initialization logic so the hooks modules have more 
      control over the configuration.
    - Most optional features are now run-time selectable rather than
      compile-time selectable.
    - Support querying for corrected and uncorrected error counts (for the 
      life of the Device instance).
    - Updated to allow cache mode reads to work with Numonyx chips.
    - Updated the PXA320 NTM to support Micron M60 flash.
    
    OneNAND NTM Enhancements:
    - Major cleanup of the NT1NAND debug messages to use NTMNAME, and to not 
      display error messages using FFXTRACEPRINTF().
    - Modified the Create() function to obtain configuration data from the 
      hook's Create() function.
    - Major update to all the fh1nand.c hooks modules to support unaligned 
      access.  They now use a standard mechanism to report configuration 
      characteristics back to the OneNAND NTM.  Made the debugging messages
      useful.
    - Updated to add support for locking and suspend/resume.
    - Updated to add support for OTP (One-Time Programming)
    - Updated to no longer use static data, to allow multiple NTM instances.
    - Split OneNAND and FlexOneNAND support into separate NTMs.

    WinCE Port:
    - Updated the to support the concept of a store which is split across
      two FlashFX Disks.
    - Added a new DLPART utility which allows command-line control of 
      creating, destroying, mounting and dismounting stores and partitions,
      as well as formatting partitions.  The functionality is also usable 
      from with the Datalight and FlashFX Shells.
    - Updated to call LockPages() for all read buffers to prevent deadlocks
      when multiple page faults occur.
    - Updated to detect warmboot notifications and properly deinitialize the 
      driver to any data is properly flushed and so any required restoration
      of hardware states can be performed.
    - Enhanced FlashFX' ability to run as an FMD with the Microsoft FAL
      (primarily used for testing and debugging).   
    - Added sample code for interfacing existing code which is currently 
      using the FMD interface to use FlashFX instead. 
    - Added support for power suspend/resume. 
    - Added CE specific example applications -- FlashFX_FML.exe and 
      FlashFX_DynamicDisk.exe, which demonstrate using the FML API, as
      well as dynamically creating a Disk, respectively.  They build using 
      the standard build processes -- however, they also have SOURCES
      files and can be built using the generic CE BUILD utility as well.
    - Modified the CE driver to set the STORAGE_DEVICE_FLAG_TRANSACTED for 
      read-only (no allocator) Disks. 
    - Modified so the CE "folder" registry setting is not required.  It will 
      be used it if it's there, but CE will use a default if not.
    - Added support for dynamically configuring the Disk definitions by 
      scanning the media for the MBR and the Flash Layout Sector (FLS). 
    - Updated the scatter/gather code to default to using stack buffers 
      rather than dynamically allocating memory.
    - Eliminated the FFX_DISK0_FORMAT setting for CE.  Disk format settings 
      for Windows CE are now handled entirely in the registry.
    - Updated the CE port to support auto-assigned Disk numbers.
    - Stopped using DefaultFileSystem values of "None", and rather use "" to 
      ensure no conflicts with CE's usage of that registry key.  The FlashFX
      code still allows the value "None" for compatibility.
    - Added GUI versions of some tests and tools.

    RTOS Port:
    - Added an example application -- FlashFX_FML.c, which demonstrates
      using the FML API.

    Linux Port:
    - Kernel versions up to 2.6.35 are now supported.
        
    VxWorks Port:
    - Added support for VxWorks 6.9.
    - Resolved a bug where FlashFX was not working properly with HRFS. 

    Win32 Port:
    - Added GUI versions of some tests and tools.
    
    Deprecated features and settings:
    - Deprecated the FMLREAD_CORRECTEDPAGES() macro.

    - Fixed an issue in FMSL Raw Page Test to ensure raw accesses don't
      occur in BBM reserved areas in multi-chip configurations.
    - Updated FMSL ECC test not to run on devices that don't require ECC.
    - Simplified FXImage tool so that linking with FlashFX core libraries is 
      no longer required. The tool now works only in VBF mode, and creates
      images that only contain user data and tags. Raw and FS modes are no
      longer available (this applies to the FlashFX Tera v1.x product only).

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    FlashFX Tera v1.1 Build 1850F - First General Release (April 2009)
                      WinCE, VxWorks, Linux, RTOS -- SDKs and CSKs

    General Concepts:
    - Added support for flash arrays up to 2 terabytes in size.
    - Added support for MLC NAND flash parts.  See the "FlashFX Supported
      Hardware.pdf" file for a detailed list.
    - Major update to BBM to allow each chip in an FML Disk to have its
      own BBM table, greatly simplifying manufacturing issues.
    - Allow for both default and customer error management policies.
    - Allow for MLC strength ECC, implemented in both hardware and software.
    - Supports Samsung Flex OneNAND.
    - Major update to the external requestor API to disassociate the
      requestor handle from a specific Disk.  Added the FlashFX_Open()
      and FlashFX_Close() functions.  Updated all tools and tests for
      non-monolithic environments to use these functions.
    - Implemented a unified, automated documentation generation system.

    Project Configuration:
    - The old FFX_DEVn_BBMFORMAT setting has been renamed to FFX_DEVn_BBM,
      and a new field allows BBM to be disabled for a Device.  BBM support
      can now be enabled/disabled both at compile-time and run-time.
    - Added an FFX_MAX_PAGESIZE setting to ffxconf.h.
    - Updated so that Allocator (VBF) support can be compiled out of the
      binary.  Enhanced the Allocator initialization so that it can be
      disabled at run-time, even if it is compiled into the binary.  The
      ffxconf.h file now has an FFX_DISKn_ALLOCATOR setting which is used
      to configure allocator settings.

    Driver Framework Enhancements:
    - Major enhancement so that Devices and Disks can be created and
      destroyed on the fly by application level code.
    - Major update to allow portions of the Driver Framework to be
      accessible via the external requestor interface.
    - Added functionality to enumerate Devices and Disks.
    - Configuration of Devices and Disks has been greatly simplified.
    - Modified FfxDriverCreate() to take a driver number rather than a name.
    - Modified FfxDriverHandle() to take a driver number parameter.

    VBF Enhancements:
    - Supports active scrubbing of bit errors.
    - Renamed the VBF region related functions to avoid namespace conflicts.
    - Enhanced VBFTEST to test large I/O operations.
    - Fixed the VBFTEST region size display to display the client size.

    DevMgr Enhancements:
    - Updated to fix several bugs with regard to the Device Create/Destroy
      operations and the FfxHookAccessBegin/End() functionality.
    - Modified so FfxDevCreate() honors a failure result from
      FfxHookAccessBegin(ACCESS_MOUNTS).
    - Fixed so that FfxHookAccessEnd(ACCESS_MOUNTS) is properly called
      even if the Device creation fails (so long as the "begin" function
      returned successfully).
    - Fixed so that the ACCESS_UNMOUNTS is issued for Device destruction.
    - Updated all the fhaccess.c modules to maintain a usage counter
      tracking accesses to the flash.  Added pseudo-code to show how to
      implement a global mutex in the event that the flash is shared with
      another flash manager.

    Miscellaneous Enhancements:
    - Fixed the FfxFatFormat() function to not depend on structure packing.
    - Updated MTSTRESS to increase the number of buffer blocks used by
      default, to better exercise large flash arrays and large I/O
      requests.
    - Updated FXDUMP to add the /WRITTEN option to cause only those pages
      which have been written to be displayed.
    - Modified a number of uses of D_UINT16 types to the much preferred
      "unsigned" type.
    - Modified the various tag related I/O functions to take a tag width
      parameter.
    - Updated to allow CHS calculations to work for disks as small as two
      sectors.
    - Fixed FlashFX_VersionCheck() to return the documented error codes.
    - Updated most OS ports to default to background compaction being on
      if thread support is on, and off if it is not.

    NAND FIM Enhancements:
    - Modified the GetPageStatus() functionality to return the tag length,
      if any.  Added macros to manage setting and retrieving the tag width
      information from the ulPageStatus value.
    - Added support for numerous additional Micron and OneNAND parts.

    PXA320 NTM Enhancements:
    - Updated to disable setting NCSX during initialization.
    - Fixed DFCConfigure() to set RA_START and PG_PER_BLK_64 if large
      block NAND is being used.
    - Fixed a bug in GetBlockStatus() where the same page was being
      examined twice.
    - Fixed a bug in DFCShutdown() where a statically declared structure
      was being freed.
    - Updated to support variable length tags.
    - Implemented the raw page read/write functions.
    - Fixed hidden read/write to use raw reads/writes, rather than using
      ECC.
    - Modified so that status bits are explicitly cleared after they are
      read.
    - Updated to add support for 16-bit NAND.
    - Corrected a bug in the definition of the page size mask.
    - Fixed to properly wait for the chip reset to complete, per the
      Marvell app note.

    Micron NTM Enhancements:
    - Updated to allow dual-plane support to be chosen at compile-time or
      run-time, as desired.  As such, the NTM now supports Micron chips
      which do not support dual-plane operations.
    - Modified so that it will not work with any parts but Micron parts.
    - Updated to support cache-mode reads and writes.

    PageIO NTM Enhancements:
    - Implemented the "raw" page read/write interface.

    FMSLTEST Enhancements:
    - Updated FMSLTEST to allow for the fact that an NTM may fix <more>
      bit errors than the minimum required, and it should not cause a
      test failure.
    - Fixed so that the blocks are erased even when error code paths are
      taken, rather than leaving the flash in a bad state.
    - Added tests for the GetPageStatus() interface.
    - Added a test to ensure that tags read from erased pages return all
      0xFFs.
    - Added a test to ensure that tags values which are all 0xFFs or
      within 1 bit thereof (in any bit position) return the correct tag
      values.
    - Modified the test to exercise all possible tag sizes if the NTM
      supports variable length tags.
    - Enhanced the BlockStatusTest() to test more conditions.
    - Enhanced the error handling and debug messages to be more useful.
    - Fixed the NAND portion of the test in several places where the
      ulBlockStatus value was not being properly masked before it was
      examined, and one place where it was being examined without first
      checking that the I/O operation was successful.
    - Fixed the block status test to take into account whether BBM is
      loaded for a Device, before drawing conclusions about whether raw
      block status should match the regular block status.
    - Simplified the logic for finding a range of good, unremapped blocks
      to test.
    - Updated the error handling to avoid asserting for out-of-range
      requests.
    - Modified the "BIG_BLOCK_SIZE" to be dynamically allocated and be the
      same size as an erase block.  This allows the performance test to do
      stuff which is more equivalent to what the VBFTEST performance test
      is doing.
    - Modified the performance tests to iterate through a range of sector
      counts when reading and writing, so bottlenecks can be identified.
    - Enhanced the alignment test to allow a smaller alignment size to be
      specified on the command-line, to simplify testing and debugging of
      alignment issues in FIMs and NTMs.

    FXIMAGE Tool Enhancements:
    - Added the ability to specify that the file contain high and/or low
      reserved space.
    - Added the XFORM option to allow tagged pages to be transformed into
      standard SSFDC or OFFSETZERO style spare areas.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the tool from working properly in "VBF"
      mode, when using NOR.

    FlashFX Shell Enhancements:
    - Added commands for dynamically creating, destroying, and enumerating
      Devices and Disks.
    - Added the BBMINFO and CB commands to the FlashFX Debugger.
    - Updated the FlashFX Debugger to function even when there are no
      Disks defined in the system.

    Windows CE:
    - Modified all the command-line tools to support an interface for
      redirecting output.
    - Added Datalight and FlashFX Shell extension DLLs, which allow the
      shell to be fully usable from within a Target Control window.
    - Turned FAT Monitor off for CE since it is not needed on CE 4.2 or
      later.
    - Updated the CE driver build process to link with B_DRIVERLIBS to
      allow additional link libraries to be specified at the project
      level.
    - Updated the FFX and DCL shell extensions for CE to use the new
      DclInputFunction() to remap how input is supplied, and avoid using
      globals.
    - Updated all the WinCE specific tools and tests wrappers to properly
      use (the new) flashfx_wince.h has the top level header.
    - Fixed the CE generation of flashfx.lib so it only contains the
      libraries used for an application using the external API.  Modified
      the build processes for all the CE specific tools to link with that
      library, rather than all the individual libraries.
    - Conditioned the "hidden sector issue" in ffxsgio.c with
      CORRECT_HIDDEN_SECTORS, and disabled it by default.  Fixed that
      same code to function correctly when structure packing is disabled.
    - Renamed FlashFXDriverEntry() to DllMain().
    - Eliminated the obsolete DetectDSKDisk() function.
    - Eliminated the FXREMNT utility.

    Win32 Port:
    - Eliminated the FXREMNT utility.

    Deprecated Features and Settings:
    - Removed the NTBYTEIO, NTOPAP, NTATLAS, and NTMX21 NTMs.
    - Removed the obsolete and unused FFX_IO_MAPPED setting and
      IOPORTADDRESS type.
    - Removed the obsolete and unused oeio.c modules.

   - Added initialization of projects (call to FfxProjMain()) in
     All-In-One-Framework builds (mostly effects simulator builds)
   - Major refactoring of the format related settings in ffxconf.h to
     allow any or all of the formatting features to be scaled out of
     the code, as well as to allow each disk to have its own format
     settings (state, file system, MBR, etc).

     now cause read errors.
   - A flash programming error in a NAND redundant write no longer
     attempts block replacement.
   - Linked TEST_BLOCK_SIZE with VBF_BLOCK_SIZE.
   - Eliminated the need to use software ECCs during block replacement.

   v4.05 Build 315 - General Release (May 2000)
   - Changed DoDiscard to handle a start block address boundary problem.
   - Fixed a FindSpareUnit initialization problem.
   - Changed VBFSort to require at least two entries before sorting.
   - Changed MountRegion to not set the sorted indicator until
     after sorted.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.04 Build 309 - Engineering Release (April 2000)
   - FlashFX has been ported to the VxWorks Real-Time Operating
     System.  Since it has not yet been thoroughly tested or
     documented, it is classified as a BETA version.
   - The erase zone size support has been increased from a maximum
     of 128KB to a maximum of 256KB.
   - A number of additional flash devices are now being supported:
       Toshiba TH58V128FT
       AMD     am29LV640/641DU
       AMD     am29LV116B/T
       AMD     am29LV017B
       AMD     am29F016B (x8 in Big Real Mode only)
       AMD     am29F040B (x8 in Big Real Mode only)
       ATMEL     29C040A (x8 in Big Real Mode only)
       SST       28F040  (x8 in Big Real Mode only)
   - The BBM (Bad Block Manager) is now automatically formatted at
     the start of TESTOEM execution when the /x option (Extensive
     Hidden Tests) is selected.
   - Removed a discard restriction to improve overall system
     performance.
   - Fixed a write problem in the istrtx16 and istrt2x8 Intel strata
     flash FIMs which only occurred when length was greater than and
     not a multiple of 32 bytes.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.04 Build 292 - General Release (March 2000)
   - Incorporated a port to Linux in the Porting Kit.  Tested on Red
     Hat v6.0, kernel 2.2.5-15.  The port should work with any other
     version of Linux with little or no changes.
   - Added support for Intel 32Mbit, 64Mbit and 128Mbit StrataFlash.
   - Added command line switch to disable the FAT monitor.
   - Corrected a Write interruption problem with AND and NAND
     flash memories.  The problem was due to an invalid
     entry into the state machine during a discard of data
     from the FAT monitor.  An interruption during a discard
     could cause corruption of the data being deleted.
   - Added support for Windows CE v2.11 and Windows CE v2.12.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.03 Build 255 - Engineering Release (June 1999)
   - Removed a test parameter which affected number of blocks
     per block map.  To speed-up the testing of multiple chunks,
     the number of blocks per chunk was set to 8 instead of 120.
     in BBM.H.  This temporary change was accidentally included
     in the last engineering release.  It has been fixed in this
     engineering release.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.03 Build 254 - Engineering Release (June 1999)
   - Significant performance enhancements have been completed in
     the BBM, eliminating performance degradation over time.
   - Added new FIM ISTRTX8.C for Strata Flash support.
   - Created a new unit test, Testbbm, which will test write
     interruptions using either random data/addresses or fixed
     data/addresses.  It will also create the desired number of
     chucks for performance testing.
   - Incorporated write interruption tests in BBMCHUNK.C and
     BBMFMT.C, which can only be activated by Testbbm.
   - Modified the AND.C and NAND.C FIMs to use a simulate write
     error macro activated by Testbbm to test write interruptions in
     the BBM code.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.02 Build 229 - Engineering Release (April 1999)
   - Modified FlashFX utilities to support RAM disks.
   - Various improvements to FlashFX Volume Management API
   - Various improvements to the fxfmt utility.
   - Added undocumented /U option in FORMAT.C to unconditionally
     format the media as if it had never been formatted before,
     i.e., no defaults.
   - Re-defined lpcScratchData in VBFDATA.H to satisfy all compilers.
   - Modified the WINCE file structure and FlashFX source to handle
     3 new CPUs (arm720, sa1100, r3000).
   - Made modifications to numerous files to avoid warning messages
     from CE 2.10 SH3 compiler (VBFDATA.H, OEM.C, TESTOEM.C,
     FIMRAM.C, AMDX8.C, AMD2X8.C, A010X8.C and VBF.C).
   - Added 2 new FIMs, AMDTBX16 and AMTB2X16, for the Am29Fx00B/T
     interleaved and non-interleaved devices, and the Fujitsu MBM
     series devices.
   - Incorporated support for the Intel 28F008SC device in the
     INTELX8.C FIM and the INTEL2X8.C FIM.
   - Improved checks and error reports in SETFXENV.BAT.
   - Incorporated support for the Am29F032B device in both the
     AMDX8.C and AMD2X8.c FIMs.
   - Added a new FIM (UNAND.C) and changed the NAND.H, BCDOS.MAK,
     GCPRT.MAK, OEMFLASH.C files to support the new AMD 30LV0064
     Ultra-Nand device.
   - Increased the default maximum number of drives from 2 to 4 in
     the BIOSCONF.INC module.
   - Flagged all printfs in FDINFO.C, REMOUNT.C, RECLAIM.C,
     RDIMAGE.C, WRIMAGE.C, CHKUNITS.C and FORMAT.C (DOS and
     QNX) to make them easier to find for modification.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.02 Build 204 - Engineering Release (February 1999)
   - Fixed memclien.c and biosdisk.asm to return correct error
     code to DOS for write-protect (funcs 02&03).
   - Changed constants in VBF.H to improve performance.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.02 Build 200 - General Release (February 1999)
   - Moved borland compiler from FlashFX to a separate CD.
   - Makefiles, SETFXENV, and MAKEALL now use FX_COMPILER if set
     and assume the tools and environment is valid if FX_COMPILER
     is not set.
   - Added code to guarantee the minimum number of free bytes
     before garbage collection is required (~5% performance boost).
   - Improved performance of the BBM.
   - Changed ASSERT.H to _ASSERT.H in order to avoid clashes with
     the C library's ASSERT.H.
   - Corrected problem in FATMON that caused valid data to be
     discarded when it shouldn't.  This problem was exercised by
     ROMDOS CHKDSK which performs multi-sector writes to the disk
     when freeing lost clusters.
   - Added pSOS boot sector detection code for DOS and BIOS drivers
     to allow pSOS to be booted and accessed from DOS.
   - Enhanced error checking in the OEM layer media access calls.
   - Changed SetTimer call to StartTimer call in unit test modules in
     order to avoid clash with Windows API calls with the same names.
   - Implemented work-around in FFXDRV.C in order to prevent WinCE
     v2.0 FATFS from calling into GWES before it is ready.
   - Added OEM HardwareInterface() call into OEMHDWR.C and OEMHDWR.PT
     in all TEMPLATE and CUSTOMER projects.
   - Wrote registry code into WINCE projects TEMPLATE and CUSTOM to
     allow start and length to be defined from within the registry
     via "Start" and "Length" values.
   - Added stub'd printf into TESTOEM and TESTVBF.  The WinCE v2.1
     build environment does not have an easy method to control the
     library link order and causes the CE printf to be linked instead
     of ours.  To avoid this problem, the unit test modules just stub
     printf in a NO_DISPLAY environment.
   - Changed QNX makeall from custom to $FX_PROJECT.
   - wcqnx.def FX_COPTION includes -fr to create error file.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.01 Build 153 - General Release (December 1998)
   - Minor modifications to build tools for better WinCE support.
   - Changed output format of FXINFO for easy readability.
   - Added new utility (FXCHK) to verify validity of spare units.
   - Minor modifications to correct Porting Kit builds with GNU.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.01 Build 119 - v4.01 Pre-Release
   - Windows CE v2.10 is now supported!  Support for various CPUs
     is now included in the WinCE supplement.
   - Windows CE supplement now includes support for the NEC Vr43xx,
     NEC Vr41xx, Hitachi SH3 and Hitachi SH4.
   - Datalight has licensed Borland C v5 for FlashFX DOS builds.
   - Microsoft C support for DOS builds has been removed.
   - Device driver and BIOS disk driver include files have been moved
     to the PROJECT\PLATFORM\CPU directory in order to allow multiple
     projects to have different configurations such as emulating hard
     or floppy disks, or different sized BIOS extensions.
   - A bug that caused file corruption in the BIOS extension when
     first drive - floppy emulation was enabled has been corrected.
   - The Porting Kit can now support 256KB erase zones at a
     significant cost to performance.  Just increase the
     VBF_BLOCK_SIZE from 512 to 1024.  VBF handles buffering.
   - Added delay option in the QNX Fsys driver to allow booting
     off a flash disk.  The system was locking in faster systems
     when access to the disk was made before the driver completed the
     hookup with the file system.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.00 Build 109 - Engineering Release (July 1998)
   - Support for Hitachi's AND flash device (HN29W6411)
     This is an engineering release and support for AND flash is
     in BETA.  It has been tested to the best of Datalight's ability
     on an ISA test board built by Hitachi.  See FIM\AND.TXT for more
     details.
   - Bad Block Management and ECC included in order to support
     Mostly Good Memory (MGM).  Hamming codes that can detect
     and correct single bit errors in 256 byte pages are implemented
     and used by the AND FIM.  Multi bit errors are detected.
   - Added Flash Interface Modules (FIM) to support AND and NAND
     flash memory.
   - Updated VBF to use new types for access to the media in
     order to control the use of ECC within the FIMs.
     MEM_VALIDATE now sets the bUseEcc flag in the media structure
     and MEM_COMMON and MEM_CONTROL re-set the flag to avoid
     use of ECC on data that normally changes during use.
   - Corrected error in VBFSUP - FindPhysAlloc().  Error was causing
     stack corruptions when the system was big endian, with
     128KB erase units in the flash.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   v4.00 Build 88 - Engineering Release (March 1998)
   - Numerous updates in order to support WinCE builds 7228,
     7281, and the v2.0 ETK release.
   - Corrected unlock sequence calculations in AMD FIMs in order
     to avoid compiler bugs with the MSVC2.0.
   - Corrected pointer manipulation in AMD2X8 and INTEL2X8 that
     caused writes larger than the windows size to fail, but less
     than 32KB to fail, updated TESTOEM to catch this error.
   - Added vbfprogressmessage() to VBFFMT for systems that needed
     progress messages, but no display output.
   - Renamed E2PROM directory to EEPROM to avoid confusion.
   - Setup SETFXENV to work with projects that don't have platform
     directory trees.
