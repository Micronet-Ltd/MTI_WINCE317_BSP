                                Description

    The functions in this module are used internally by Datalight products.
    Typically these functions are used rather than the similarly named,
    general Standard C library functions.  Typically this is done for
    compatibility, portability, and code size reasons.

    These functions are NOT intended to be complete, 100% ANSI C compatible
    implementations, but rather are designed address specific needs.

    See the specific function headers for more information about departures
    from the ANSI standard, and missing or extended functionality.
