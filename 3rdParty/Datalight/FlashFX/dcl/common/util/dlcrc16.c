                                Description

    Implements a table based CRC16 calculation that will compute a
    CRC-16 based on the polynomial: x^16+x^15+x^2+1.  This is *not*
    compliant to the CCITT-16 description.

    NOTE: the CRC's produced by this function may be used for on-media
    structures. Changes or 'fixes' must be highly scrutinized before
    being incorporated.

    Public: DclCrc16Update()

    Compute a CRC16 for the given data buffer.  This is *not* the
    CCITT-16 compliant CRC.  The initial CRC must be set to 0.  To
    CRC multiple buffers, call this function with the previously
    returned CRC value.

    Parameters:
        uCrc16  - The starting CRC value.
        pBuffer - Data buffer to calculate the CRC from.
        nLength - Number of bytes of data in the given buffer.

    Return Value:
        Returns the updated CRC value.
