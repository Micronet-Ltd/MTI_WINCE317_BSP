    Public: DclOsThreadID()

    Return the thread ID for the current thread.  A valid thread ID
    may never be zero.

    Note that this function must be implemented even if the
    DCL_OSFEATURE_THREADS setting is FALSE.  In an environment
    where threading is disabled or not supported, this function
    should be stubbed to return any legal (non-zero) value.

    Parameters:
        None.

    Return Value:
        Returns a DCLTHREADID value if successful, otherwise zero.
